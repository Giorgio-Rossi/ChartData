<h1>📈 ChartData</h1>
<p>In this project I graphically represented the sales data of a chain of stores, both physical and online, assigning all the items to a category.
The data represented is fictitious and varies with each page refresh.</p>
<h2>📦 Technologies</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</code></li>
<li><code>AlaSQL</code></li>
<li><code>Apache ECharts</code></li>
<li><code>SQL Query</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>🎯 The goal</h2>
<p>The goal was to create a javascript virtual database populated with fictional data and then manipulate and represent it graphically.</p>
<h2>👩🏽‍🍳 The process</h2>
<p>I started by focusing on the back end by understanding how to create a virtual database using AlaSQL and integrate it with the front end. </p>
<p>I defined the various entities and then moved on to creating the front end.</p>
<p>To represent the data present in DB I've used the Apache Echarts library, then I joined the backend to the frontend, merging the javascript scripts with the CSS library to the HTML page</p>
